Hello World
This is the text file
#Check status of files (staged/committed)
git status
#Add a file to the staging area
git add filename.fileextension
#Add all files of the current directory to the staging area
git add .
#Commit files
git commit -m "Insert the comments for the submission here"
#Push to GitHub
git push origin main
# Where origin is the name of the remote server
# Where main is the name of the branch
# If using default names (origin and branch) you can write
git push

Commands related to a remote repository:
git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
Commands related to the workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
Commands related to checking status or log history
git status
git log
The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
